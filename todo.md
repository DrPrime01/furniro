# To Do

- Remove product card overlay for mobile screens and add the like, share, and view buttons to the card content
- When a user clicks the like button, the product should be added to the wishlist (requires auth)
- When a user clicks the share button, a modal should pop-up to show which social media the user wants to share the product to.
- Implement pagination
- Implement the filter on the shop page for tablet to mobile screens
